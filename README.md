FirstAndroidApp
===============
This is my first Android project.
This is an Application which allows you to send text messages, Emails and bluetooth chat by voice (Using Speech to text synthesis).
You may type the text message or just speak it up, it will type the message for you and send it with a click.
Along with the app, it has a home screen widget which you can click and say "send message" or "send email" followed by your message to open up the app and compose your text message or email directly.
It also lets you forward messages in text inbox as email or text message with a click.

This is an Eclipse project containing source files and compiled binary files for installation.
