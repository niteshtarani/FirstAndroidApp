FirstAndroidApp
===============
This is my first Android project.
This is a Text and Mail Application which allows you to send text messages and Emails by voice (Using Speech to text synthesis).
You may type the text message or just speak it up, it will type the message for you and send it with a click.

This is an Eclipse project containing source files and compiled binary files for installation.
